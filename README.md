# Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis

## Description
In this project, we perform an exploratory data analysis on the Roller Coaster Database. This dataset contains information about various roller coasters around the world, including their names, locations, heights, speeds, lengths, and more. The goal is to explore the dataset to understand the distribution of different features, identify interesting patterns, and visualize relationships between various attributes.

## Objectives
- Understand the structure and contents of the Roller Coaster Database.
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Compute descriptive statistics for key features.
- Visualize the distribution of various attributes.
- Analyze correlations between different features.
- Identify any outliers or anomalies in the data.

## Summary of Steps
1. **Load Data**: Import the dataset and necessary libraries.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct any inconsistencies.
3. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculate mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and other statistics for key features.
4. **Data Visualization**: Create histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and other visualizations to explore the data.
5. **Correlation Analysis**: Use correlation matrices and heatmaps to examine relationships between features.
6. **Outlier Detection**: Identify and analyze outliers to understand their impact on the data.
