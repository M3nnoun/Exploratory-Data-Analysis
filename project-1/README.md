## Project Name
Roller Coaster Exploratory Data Analysis

## Dataset
Roller Coaster Database

## Description
In this project, we will perform an exploratory data analysis on the Roller Coaster Database. This dataset contains information about various roller coasters around the world, including their names, locations, heights, speeds, lengths, and more. The goal is to explore the dataset to understand the distribution of different features, identify any interesting patterns, and visualize the relationships between various attributes.

## Objectives
- Understand the structure and contents of the Roller Coaster Database.
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Compute descriptive statistics for key features.
- Visualize the distribution of various attributes.
- Analyze correlations between different features.
- Identify any outliers or anomalies in the data.

## Files
- `coaster_annalyse.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis code and results.
- `coaster_db.csv`: The dataset used for this project.

## Key Results
- Distribution of roller coaster heights, speeds, and lengths.
- Correlation analysis between different features.
- Visualizations highlighting interesting patterns and outliers.
